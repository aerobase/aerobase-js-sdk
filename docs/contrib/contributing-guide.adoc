= Contributing to AeroBase JavaScript SDK

First, ensure you have the https://docs.npmjs.com/[latest npm] installed.

Then, to set everything up run in your terminal:
[source,bash]
npm install
npm run bootstrap

== Project Structure
The SDK is made by a group of modules, each one implemented in a different NPM package and all placed under `/packages`.

Each module provides an API to use a particular AeroBase service.

A main package called `core` contains a shared set of interfaces, classes and other functionalities that the rest of modules depend on.

== Working on modules

Modules are written in https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] and tested by https://mochajs.org/[mocha].

Once the development is done, the module is built and the source code is transpiled into a `dist/` folder and published. Typings are automatically generated during this step as well.

== Commands

Run this commands from the repo's root directory.

==== Bootstrap submodules
[source,bash]
npm run bootstrap

==== Run tests with coverage
[source,bash]
npm run test

==== Run linter
[source,bash]
npm run lint

==== Build
[source,bash]
npm run build

== Adding a new module

Create a new NPM package under the packages folder with the module name: `/packages/my-module`, using our link:../templates/package.json[package.json template].

Ensure to include the org scope to its name: `"name": "@aerobase/my-module"`.

Finally, add the following link:../templates/tsconfig.json[`tsconfig.json`].

== Publishing a module

Please refer to the https://github.com/aerobase/aerobase-js-sdk/blob/master/docs/releng.adoc[Release Docs].

== Demo App

Testing can be done using the demo application:

https://github.com/aerobase-demo/angular-oauth2-starter

The master branch of the linked demo application will always use the latest released sdk packages. However,
if you wish to use the demo application for SDK development then ensure you have linked the relevant packages locally as follows:

[source,bash]
npm run build
npm run link

If you wish, you may then also use the provided script cloneExamples.sh to clone the demo application into the SDK's
root folder.

Once you have the demo application cloned you can then run the following from within its root folder:

[source, bash]
npm install
npm run linkDev

Which will tell the demo application to use the linked (local) version of the SDKs instead of the released ones.
